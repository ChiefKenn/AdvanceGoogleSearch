Construct complex Google Search queries to identify publicly available
sensitive information.

Background
Complex google search queries can be created using various online tools,without the user having to remember all the filters. OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) investigations often require more
complex queries than those used for general research purposes, and toolsmake it easy to build them.

Exercise
Select and use a tool to construct complex search queries for the provided use-cases.

Specifications:
I.  Goal:The goal is to use online tools to construct complex search queries. Then, use the queries to perform OSINT and retrieve sensitive information.

II. Lab Setup: Research and select a tool that you can use to construct complex search queries (eg: Advangle, DorkGPT, etc).You may need to modify generated queries for accurate results.

III. Construct Complex search queries and perform queries on Google.
● The selected target website is 'The Hacker News

● From the website, select an author of your choice who publishes articles regularly. Construct a search query to find all articles written by that author on a selected Advanced
Persistent Threat (APT). Use at least three keywords and phrases related to the APT in your search query.
